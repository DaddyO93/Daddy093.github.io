# astroids-ish
A game built in JavaScript reminiscent of Asteroids

If you are old like me, you remember the old Atari - the good 'ol days...

This game was built using the tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI9idPTT0c4, with minor alterations. Since I'm still learning, it's fairly close to the original in the tutorial.
