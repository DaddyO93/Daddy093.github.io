## astroids-ish

A game built in JavaScript reminiscent of Asteroids

If you are old like me, you remember the old Atari - the good 'ol days... Hours spent zooming around the screen, blasting bolders. 

In this version you don't move, but the baddies do! And yes, they really are coming straight at you. How long can you last?

This game was started using the tutorial from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI9idPTT0c4, but continues to evolve as I tweak it.
